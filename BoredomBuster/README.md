# EGG-Lighting-Test
This project was created using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. To execute this project, clone the repository and then double-click the index.html file. A choice I took that is worth highlighting is that the documentation for the Bored API does not provide a url path to donate from a separate domain but only through its website, therefore I opted to reverse engineer the website's javascript code. Finally, I discovered the url route and created a donating form on my website. Hopefully, the cors policy did not prohibit me from carrying out this activity.
