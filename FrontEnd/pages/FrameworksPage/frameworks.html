                <p class="main__copy">
                    Think of building websites and web apps like building a house—when you set out to build a house, you
                    could create all of your own building materials from scratch and start building without any schematics,
                    but that approach would be incredibly time-consuming and doesn’t make a lot of sense. It’s more likely
                    that you would purchase pre-manufactured building materials (wood, bricks, countertops, etc.) and then
                    assemble them based on a blueprint to fit your specific needs.<br><br>
                    At their most basic, JS frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide
                    developers with pre-written JS code to use for routine programming features and tasks—literally a
                    framework to build websites or web applications around.<br><br>
                    If you need a standard JavaScript photo carousel on a webpage, for instance, you can use code from a
                    framework to provide the feature for you (while you spend more time on coding the unique aspects of your
                    site that don’t have an easy, plugin solution). If you’ve heard of the singular JavaScript library
                    jQuery, this might sound familiar, but there’s a small (yet important) distinction when it comes to
                    singular JavaScript libraries versus JavaScript frameworks.

                    <p class="main__copy">
                        AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your
                        template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and
                        succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would
                        otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any
                        server technology.

                    <p class="main__copy">
                        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end, JavaScript
                        library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of
                        individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or
                        mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to
                        the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for
                        routing, as well as certain client-side functionality

                    <p class="main__copy">
                        Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework, which is used to build UIs (User
                        Interfaces) and SPAs (Single-page Applications). This framework is famous for its fast-paced learning
                        curve. It is such an easy to learn and approachable library that with the knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript, we can start building web applications in Vue.js.
